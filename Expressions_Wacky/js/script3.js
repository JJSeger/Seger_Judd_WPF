// This is a Wacky Calculator that is going to calculate farts
//Judd Seger- Week 2 Assignment - Expressions_Wacky


// created initial warning alert
alert("WARNING THE FOLLOWING MIGHT\n SEEM TO BE A LITTLE WEIRD!!! ")


//created initial prompt and assigned it to the variable fart
var fart = prompt("Have you ever wondered how\n many times you pass gas during the day?");


// Created the Good us too alert
alert(+ fart " Good Because We Have Too!");


//prompting the user to enter how many times per hour they pass gas
var bigFart = prompt("Now we obviously have to ask...\n  how many times per hour do you ....\n  Float the old rotten apple?");

//creating a variable dayFart to store the amount of times per day that the user breaks wind
var dayFart = bigFart * 24;



// displaying to the console that we need to multiply by 24
console.log("That means that in order for us to calculate\n how many times you burn your britches \nwe need to multiply by 24 hours in a day.");
